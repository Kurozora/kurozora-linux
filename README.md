[Kurozora](https://kurozora.app) is your one-stop shop for everything anime!

The Kurozora Linux client app gives you access to the huge catalogue of anime, manga and games. It is designed to be:

* **üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Responsive:** Kurozora is built with C++, one of the **fast**, **powerful** and **reliable** programming languages.

* **üíª Colossal:** The app is carefully designed to work perfectly on all screen sizes. Yes even on Samsung's Insane 292-Inch Wall TV.

* **üé® Chameleon:** Whether black, blue, purple, or orange, it fits right with your custom theme that you spent countless hours to perfect instead of doing your work.

* **üìö Documented:** With up to 85% documentation coverage.

* **üíï Excellence:** [Kurozora API](https://github.com/kurozora/kurozora-web) and Kurozora app are simply meant to be for each other. It‚Äôs like peanut butter and jelly, like yin and yang, like a lace in a shoe, like you're the sail of my love boat wait.. ughhh‚Ä¶

# Requirements

A Linux machine with GTK 4 support.

# Tools

Kurozora uses a few 3rd party tools to make development as easy and uniform as possible.

##  GTK 4

[GTK](https://gtk.org) is the primary library used for creating the user interface.

## CPR

[C++ Requests](https://docs.libcpr.org) is a simple wrapper around libcurl inspired by the excellent Python Requests project. This is used for sending API requests.
